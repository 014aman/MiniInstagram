# MiniInstagram

The application is deployed (But it will take 50sec for loading first time, as I have utilised free service of Render.com) :- https://mininstagram.onrender.com/
You can use :- username :- demouser , password :- demopass

To run on your device you need to have node.js installed, if you have atlas account use that, otherwise install mongoDB.

Just start with : 1. npm install and then 2. node index.js

And you are good to go.
